upgrade:
  - To ensure nodepool test run on a fresh node,
    the zuul parameter-function is now set in the
    read only config/zuul/layout.yaml file.
    If the ^.*$ parameter function is set in another
    file, it needs to be manually removed in
    the upgrade proposed change "Upgrade of base config
    repository files".
