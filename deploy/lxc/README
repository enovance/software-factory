Here is the bootstrap of the SF using LXC containers
----------------------------------------------------

Warning, the LXC deployment is targeted for testing purpose !


Once the SF edeploy roles has been built you can deploy a SF instance.

* deploy.py init : Bootstrap of a SF instance locally
* deploy.py destroy : Stop and clean data of the running SF instance
* deploy.py stop : Stop the running SF instance (data will be safe)
* deploy.py start : Start a SF instance that has been stopped
