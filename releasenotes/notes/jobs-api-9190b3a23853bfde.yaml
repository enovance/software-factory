features:
  - The Jobs API allows authorized users to start and
    stop jobs on the platform, and also list details about
    them. "Jobs" refers to a "build" in Jenkins terminology;
    jobs definition is still managed through the config
    repository.
    sfmanager includes the new "job" subcommand allowing
    users to interact with this API from the CLI.
issues:
  - query filtering is currently limited to job id, change
    number and patchset (ie fetch jobs that were run for a
    given gerrit change). Furthermore the job name must
    be specified.
  - possible performances issues due to the jenkins API
    handling filtering poorly (there's actually no job filtering).
    Looking up jobs might take substantial time on a
    deployment with some history.
