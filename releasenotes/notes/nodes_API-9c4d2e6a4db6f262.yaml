features:
  - "nodes" REST API
    The endpoint at manage/nodes/ allows users with adequate
    clearance to manage dynamic executors; typically nodes spawned
    by Nodepool. The endpoint supports listing nodes, holding
    a node up after a job, deleting such an node, and allowing
    an ssh key to connect to a node. The endpoint at
    /manage/nodes/image/ can be used to list current images.
upgrade:
  - The policies file is upgraded to include the default
    access policies for the API.
