security:
  - Managesf and cauth directory was exposing gerrit admin access through
    http because of missing ACLs. Admin user password, Redmine API key,
    github client_secret and mysql local access may have been leaked through
    pre-auth access to config.py. Please follow documentation instructions
    to regenerate thoses secrets, http://softwarefactory-project.io/docs/auths.html.
    Github oauth secrets needs to be manually changed.
