Openstack were hundrends of commit are pushed and automatically
tested in a day.

Software Factory will hightly facilite the deployment and
configuration of a such tools. Indeed instead of losing time to
try to understand deployment details of each components,
Software Factory will bootstrap for you a working platform

and volumes.

It is also possible to run a test deployement in LXC
containers.
