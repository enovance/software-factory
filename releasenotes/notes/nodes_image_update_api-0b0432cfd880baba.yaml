features:
  - nodes images update REST API
    The endpoint at manage/nodes/images allows users with adequate
    clearance to manage the images used to spawn dynamic executors.
    The endpoint supports listing images (provider required) and
    starting the update of an image. The status of an update and its
    logs can be fetched through the API as well.
  - nodes images update API support in the CLI
    sfmanager provides the new command "image" to list and update
    nodepool images from the CLI. It can also be used to retrieve
    build logs related to an image update (please note that these logs
    are only available for updates triggered through this API).
upgrade:
  - The policies file is upgraded to include the default
    access policies for the API.
  - The managesf database has a new table that stores updates outcomes
    for archival.
