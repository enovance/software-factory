Here is the bootstrap of the SF using LXC containers
----------------------------------------------------

Warning, the LXC deployment is targeted for testing purpose !


Once the SF edeploy roles has been built you can deploy a SF instance.

* start.sh init : Bootstrap of a SF instance locally
* start.sh destroy : Stop and clean data of the running SF instance
* start.sh stop : Stop the running SF instance (data will be safe)
* start.sh start : Start a SF instance that has been stopped
