fixes:
  - Until now aonymous access to view a repository content in gitweb was
    not possible. The reason was a missing ACL to allow read access to
    refs/meta/config for the groups "Anonymous Users" and "Registered Users".

    This has been changed, and the mentioned ACL is now added to the
    All-Projects repository, inherited by default in other projects.
    Finally anonymous gitweb access to public repos is now possible. 

    Private repos should update their project.config and disable
    anonymous access to this ref. Note that even without this change it
    is not possible to access the branches except refs/meta/config on
    private repos.
