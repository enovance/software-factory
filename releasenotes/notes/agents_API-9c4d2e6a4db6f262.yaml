features:
  - "agents" REST API
    The endpoint at manage/agents/ allows users with adequate
    clearance to manage dynamic agents; typically nodes spawned
    by Nodepool. The endpoint supports listing agents, holding
    an agent up after a job, deleting such an agent, and allowing
    an ssh key to connect to an agent. The endpoint at
    /manage/agents/image/ can be used to list current images,
    and update them.
issues:
  - Calling PUT manage/agents/image/<provider>/<image>/ for an
    image update might be blocking on the manageSF server.
    Use with caution.
upgrade:
  - The policies file is upgraded to include the default
    access policies for the API.
