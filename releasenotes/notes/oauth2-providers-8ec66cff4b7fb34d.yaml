features:
  - Added OAuth2 authentication with Google (G+ API)
  - Added OAuth2 authentication with BitBucket
issues:
  - Deployers might run into data collision when more than
    one external provider (OAuth, OpenID) is enabled. It
    is advised to use only one Identity Provider at a time.
deprecations:
  - All OAuth2 providers must use the callback URL
    https://fqdn/auth/login/oauth2/callback - The configuration
    of the 3rd party app on github must be modified accordingly.
